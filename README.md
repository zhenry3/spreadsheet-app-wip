## Spreadsheet APP WIP
### Version 0.05
[Live Demo](https://zhenry3.github.io/spreadsheet-app-wip/) | [Changelog](https://zhenry3.github.io/spreadsheet-app-wip/changelog.txt)
### Summary
A basic work in progress spreadsheet app.
I was bored one day, so I decided to make a spreadsheet app. The progress up until now has been the culmination of around 8 hours of work during the month of November 2024.
I will continue working on the project in the future, but currently I am too busy with other things.

### Features
The app currently supports:
* Rich Text Formatting
* Arrow Key Navigation
* Creating and Deleting Rows

### Future Features
The app will (sometime in the future) support:
* Ability to Import and Export CSV Files
* Session Storage
* Cell Programming
* Selecting Multiple Cells at a Time (Rows or Columns)
